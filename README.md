Have you ever faced a challenge testing your sugarcrm scheduler ?<br/>
If no, you are an awesome developer, take a bow. If <b>yes</b>, we are in the same boat.<br/>
I have many a times got into situation where I have to test a particular scheduler code and need to wait for a minute till sugar's default scheduler runs and picks my job. Also, everytime, I have to refresh my sugarcrm log file to see some useful stuff for debugging. Now, I have a solution.<br/>
This sugarcrm plugin will help you run your <b>scheduler at go and display the output instantly</b> on the screen for debugging.<br/>
