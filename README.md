# SugarCRM Instant Run Job
Have you ever faced a challenge testing your sugarcrm scheduler ?<br/>
If no, you are an awesome developer, take a bow. If <b>yes</b>, we are in the same boat.<br/>
I have many a times got into situation where I have to test a particular scheduler code and need to wait for a minute till sugar's default scheduler runs and picks my job. Now, I have a solution.<br/>
This plugin will help developers to run sugar <b>scheduled jobs instantly</b> without waiting for anything and works independent of sugarcrm cron setup.<br/>
Note: Developed and tested on SugarCRM ENT 7.9.0.0
